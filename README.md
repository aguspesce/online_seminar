### Title: How to manage multi-dimensional arrays?

__Summary__

Xarray is an open source project and Python package that makes working with labelled multi-dimensional arrays simple, efficient and with fewer errors.
Xarray is inspired by and borrows heavily from pandas.
It is particularly tailored to work with netCDF files and integrates tightly with Dask for parallel computing. 

On this opportunity, I want to convey to you why I consider Xarray a very powerful tool and show you some functionalities that I frequently use on my research.
I will also show some examples on how I use Xarray for manage, store and visualize data produced by the geodynamical modelling software Mandyoc, developed by Vict Sacek (USP).
